# Sliding Window

The Sliding Window pattern is used to perform a required operation on a specific window size of a given array or linked list.

One common problem would be to find the longest subarray containing all 1s.
 
Sliding windows start from the 1st element and keep shifting right by one element, adjusting the length of the window according to the problem. 

In some cases, the window size remains constant, and in other cases, the window size grows or shrinks.

## Ways to identify

1. Problem input is a linear data structure.
    - Linked list, array or string.

2. Asked to find the longest / shortest substring, subarray, or desired value.

## Problems

#### [Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K](/02.%20Maximum%20Sum%20Subarray%20of%20Size%20K.py) 

> Given an array of positive numbers and a positive number `‘k’`, find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size `‘k’`.

##### Brute force
A basic brute force solution would be to calculate the sum of all `'k'` sized subarrays of the given array to find the subarray with the highest sum.
We can start from every index of the given array and add the next `'k'` elements to find the subarray's sum.

```
function maxSubarrayOfSizeK(arr, k) {}
```

- Time complexity of the solution above is `O(n*k)`, where `n` is the total number of elements in the array and `k` is the size of the subarray


##### Sliding window 

We can utilize the sum of the previous subarray to calculate the next subarray. To do so, consider each subarray as a sliding window of size `'k'`. To calculate the sum of the next subarray, we need to slide the window ahead by one element. So to slide the window forward and calculate the sum of hte new position of the sliding window, we need to do two things:

1. Subtract the element going out of the sliding window (the first element)

2. Add the new element coming in 

This approach saves us from recalculating the overlapping part of the sliding window


```
function maxSubarrayOfSizeK(arr, k) {}
```

- Time complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(n)`

- Space complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(1)`

#### [Smallest Subarray with a given sum](/03.%20Smallest%20Subarray%20with%20a%20given%20sum.py)

> Given an array of positive numbers and a positive number 'S', find the length of the smallest contiguous subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to 'S'.
> 
> Return 0 if no such subarray exists.

We can use a similar strategy used in **Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K**. There is one difference though: in this problem, the sliding window size is not fixed.
Here is one approach for this problem 

1. Add up elements from the beginning of the array until their sum becomes greater than or equal to `'S'`.

2. These elements will constitute our sliding window. Remember the current length of our window as the smallest window so far.

3. After this, keep adding one element in the sliding window in a stepwise fashion.

4. In each step, we will also try to shrink the window from the beginning. We will shrink the window until the window's sum is smaller than `'S'` again. This is needed to find the smallest window. This shrinking will also happen in multiple steps; in each step, we will do two things: 

- Check if the current window length is the smallest so far, and if so, remember its length.
- Subtract the first element of the window from the running sum to shrink the sliding window.

```
function maxSubarrayOfSizeK(arr, k) {}
```

- The time complexity of the above algorithm is `O(n)`. The outer for loop runs for all elements, and the inner while loop processes each element only once; therefore the algorithm requires 2n operations.

- The algorithm runs in constant space `O(1)`.

#### [Longest Substring with Maximum K distinct characters](/04.%20Longest%20Substring%20with%20Maximum%20K%20distinct%20characters.py)

> Given a string, find the length of the **longest substring** in it with no more than K distinct characters.
>
> You can assume that K is less than or equal to the length of the given string.
