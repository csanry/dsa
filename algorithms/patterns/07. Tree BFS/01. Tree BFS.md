# Tree Breadth First Search 

This pattern is based on the Breadth First Search (BFS) technique to traverse a tree.

Any problem invoking the traversal of a tree in a level-by-level order can be efficiently solved using this approach.

The procedure requires a queue to keep track of all the nodes of a level before we jump onto the next level.

This also means that the space complexity of the algorithm will be `O(W)`, where `W` is the maximum number of nodes on any level

## Problems

#### [Binary Tree Level Order Traversal](./02.%20Maximum%20Sum%20Subarray%20of%20Size%20K.py) 

> Given a binary tree, populate an array to represent its level by level traversal. You should populate the values of nodes of each level from left to right in separate sub-arrays. 

Since we need to traverse all nodes of each level before moving to the next level, we can use the Breadth First Search (BFS) technique to solve this problem.

We can use a queue to efficiently traverse in a BFS fashion. Here are the steps of our algorithm:

1. Start by pushing the `root` node to the queue
2. Keep iterating until the queue is empty
3. In each iteration, first count the elements in the queue (let's call it `level_size`). We will have these many nodes in the current level.
4. Next, remove `level_size` nodes from the queue and push their value in an array to represent the current level.
5. After removing each node from the queue, insert both of its children into the queue.
6. If the queue is not empty, repeat from step 3 for the next level.

- Time complexity of the above algorithm is `O(n)`, where `n` is the total number of nodes in the tree. This is because we traverse each node once.

- The space complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(n)` as we need to return a list containing the level order traversal. We also need `O(n)` space for the queue. Since we can have a maximum of `n/2` nodes at any level (this could only happen at the lowest level), therefore we will need `O(n)` space to store them in the queue.


 
#### [Reverse Level Order Traversal](link)

> Given a binary tree, populate an array to return its level-by-level traversal in reverse order, ie. the lowest level comes first.
> You should populate the values of all nodes in each level from left to right in separate sub-arrays.

This problem follows the **Binary Tree Level Order Traversal** pattern. We can follow the same BFS approach. The only difference will be that instead of appending the current level at the end, we will append the current level at the beginning of the result list.

- Time complexity of the above algorithm is `O(n)`, where `n` is the total number of nodes in the tree. This is because we traverse each node once.

- The space complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(n)` as we need to return a list containing the level order traversal. We also need `O(n)` space for the queue. Since we can have a maximum of `n/2` nodes at any level (this could only happen at the lowest level), therefore we will need `O(n)` space to store them in the queue.

> Given an array of positive numbers and a positive number `‘k’`, find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size `‘k’`.

#### [Level Averages in a Binary Tree](link)

> Given a binary tree, populate an array to represent the averages of **all** its levels

This problem follows the **Binary Tree Level Order Traversal** pattern. We can follow the same **BFS** approach. The only difference will be that instead of keeping track of all nodes of a level, we will only track the running sum of the values of all nodes in each level.

In the end, we append the average of the current level to the result array.

- The space complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(n)` as we need to return a list containing the level order traversal. We also need `O(n)` space for the queue. Since we can have a maximum of `n/2` nodes at any level (this could only happen at the lowest level), therefore we will need `O(n)` space to store them in the queue.

#### [Level Maximum in a Binary Tree](link)

> Find the largest value on each level of a binary tree.

We will follow a similar approach, but instead of having a running sum we will track the maximum value of each level.


#### [Minimum Depth of a Binary Tree]()

> Find the minimum depth of a binary tree. The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node to the nearest leaf node.

This problem follows the **Binary Tree Level Order Traversal** pattern. We can follow the same **BFS** approach. The only difference will be, instead of keeping track of all the nodes in a level, we will only track the depth of the tree. 

As soon as we find our first leaf node, that level will represent the minimum depth of the tree.



- Time complexity of the above algorithm is `O(n)`, where `n` is the total number of nodes in the tree. This is because we traverse each node once.

- The space complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(n)` as we need to return a list containing the level order traversal. We also need `O(n)` space for the queue. Since we can have a maximum of `n/2` nodes at any level (this could only happen at the lowest level), therefore we will need `O(n)` space to store them in the queue.

#### [Maximum Depth of a Binary Tree]()

> Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth (or height).

We will follow similar approach to the **Minimum Depth of a Binary Tree**. Instead of returning as soon as we find a leaf node, we will keep traversing for all the levels, incrementing max_depth each time we complete a level.


#### [Level Order Successor]()

> Given a binary tree and a node, find the level order successor of the given node in a tree. The level order successor is the node that appears right after the given node in the level order traversal.

This problem follows the **Binary Tree Level Order Traversal** pattern. We can follow the same **BFS** approach. The only difference will be that we will not keep track of all the levels. Instead we will keep inserting child nodes to the queue.

As soon as we find the given node, we will return the next node from the queue as the level order successor.
