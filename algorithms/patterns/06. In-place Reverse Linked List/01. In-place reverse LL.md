# In-place Reversal of a Linked List

In a lot of problems, we are asked to reverse the links between a set of nodes of a linked list. Often, the constraint is that we need to do this in-place, ie. using the existing node objects and without using extra memory. 

The **Inplace Reversal of a Linkedlist** pattern describes an efficient way to solve the above problem.

## Problems

#### [Problem](./02.%20Maximum%20Sum%20Subarray%20of%20Size%20K.py) 

> Given the head of a Singly Linkedlist, reverse the Linkedlist. Write a function to return the new head of the reverse Linkedlist.

To reverse a linked list, we need to reverse one node at a time. We will start with a variable `current` which will initially point to the head of the linked list and a variable `previous` which will point to the previous node that we have processed; initially `previous` will point to `null`.

In a stepwise manner, we will reverse the `current` node by pointing it to the `previous` before moving on to the next node.
Also, we will update the `previous` to always point to the previous node that we have processed. 

- The time complexity of our algorithm will be `O(N)` where `'N'` is the total number of nodes in the linked list.

- We only used constant space (storage for two pointers), therefore the space complexity is `O(1)`.

#### [Reverse a Sub-list](link)

> Given the head of a linked list and two positions `p` and `q`, reverse the linked list from position `p` to `q`.

The problem follows the **In-place Reversal of a Linkedlist** pattern. We can use a similar approach as discussed in **Reverse a Linkedlist**.

1. Skip the first `p-1` nodes, to reach the node at position `p`.
2. Remember the node at position `p-1` to be useld later to connect with the reversed sub-list.
3. Next, reverse the nodes from `p` to `q` using the same approach discussed in **Reverse a LinkedList**.
4. Connect the `p-1` and `q+1` nodes to the reversed sub-list.

- Time complexity of our algorithm will be `O(N)` where `N` is the total number of nodes in the linked list.
- Space complexity of our algorithm is `O(1)`.
